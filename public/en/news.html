			<h2>ChangeMan - Rethinking Resistance </h2>

                <p>In an engineering organization, the top-management had decided to change the way the company developed its new products. The company had constituted a New Product Development (NPD) team in each of its business divisions. The different business divisions were located in small towns across India. The NPD teams were assigned two major tasks. First, they were expected to develop ideas for new products. Second, they would run new product trials in close collaboration with line departments. It was anticipated that 4 to 6 promising ideas for new products would be ready within a year. After the new product ideas get approved by the leadership team, they would be taken up for commercial production.</p>
                <p>The NPD teams from different business divisions met at the company headquarters to work out their strategy and their approach. In one of the business divisions, the leader of the newly constituted NPD team called a meeting to present the broad approach to the line managers. He pointed out that the present organization was not geared to develop new products. Then he outlined the role and importance of the new initiative. He added that members of the NPD team will approach them initially for obtaining data and their views. After a few months, they will request them for help with conducting trials. He paused to see if there were any questions.</p>
                <p>An employee at the meeting turned to Employee C sitting next to him and whispered: “What do you think this means?” His friend C responded: ‚I have no idea. What is he talking about? We are still number one in our market. How will this new team help in any way? And why do they need a series of meetings with all of us? Don’t they know what they want to do?”</p>
                <p>At another table, Employee E slouched back in his chair in apparent disgust. The person next to him raised his eyebrows to non-verbally inquire why he seemed so distressed. “I am sick of these knee-jerk changes” was E’s response. “Why is this necessary? We have been coming up regularly with new products. What does he mean by saying that we’re not geared to develop new products? I have personally contributed to two new products. You have done that. They will destroy the present arrangement. And this team idea is totally hare-brained.”</p>
                <p>At the very back of the room two other colleagues looked at each other. Employee P seemed quite annoyed. ‚Do they seriously expect to come up with new products with this team”, he said. “We know how some persons have got on the team, and whose ideas they’ll keep parroting. It is joke to believe that we are going to entrust the strategic direction of the company to this group. The management clearly has some ulterior motive”.</p>
                <p>Most of us would say that the three employees are exhibiting resistance, and resistance is the primary reason why most changes fail. Rick Maurer1, a change scholar would only partly agree with the above statement. </p>
