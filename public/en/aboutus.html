				<h3>Greetings!</h3>
				<div class="clearfix">
					<div class="item">
						<p>I founded HCD out of a belief that ‘experiential learning’ programs and technologies can transcend the limitations of China’s traditional educational system, providing multinational corporations with impeccably trained and skilled leaders.   Now, ten years later, I am grateful for, and frankly in awe of, the trust that many of the world’s most respected companies and business schools have placed in us.   Thanks to you, we remain committed to continually investing in the development of he highest quality, professional-skill development products and services.It is important to understand the inspiration behind HCD Learning and the values that guide our work. Constantly adapting to uncertain, challenging circumstances, I discovered survival instincts early on in life. The resilience I came to understand as a child is the original inspiration behind HCD Learning– a business that allows me to help entrepreneurial companies not only survive, but succeed in unpredictable and difficult environments.</p>
						<p>As a young adult, I became intrigued by how behavior is affected by “mindset,” influencing the decisions we make and ultimately how we work with others to create results. In fact, I originally studied psychology in the United States. In more recent years, I have become a passionate student of Chinese Taoism and Buddhism, through which I’ve learned that the most potent leaders bring strategic skills, physical strength and emotional intelligence into true balance.</p>
						<p>These three dimensions to leadership, however, are just the beginning. To lead is a lifelong spiritual journey of discovery through the laws of the universe (Taoism) and the laws of human nature (Buddhism). We design HCD Learning’s programs to harmonize philosophies from ancient eastern doctrines with scientific theory and western business practices. In doing so, we change mindset and behavior, preparing our clients to succeed in a fast-changing world.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="item pull-right">
						<p>Later in life I spent several years on Wall Street, an experience that has profoundly influenced the value I place on skilled leadership, quality decision-making, and the role of technology in helping professionals hone strengths, address weaknesses and build confidence.  To that end, HCD Learning’s pioneering work with business simulation games is core to how we shape effective leaders for our corporate clients.</p>
						<p>Lastly, I profoundly believe that teams and companies must partner to achieve results together. HCD Learning’s Chinese name, 合得, means ‘winning together’, which is born out of our view that finding ways to collaborate is the fastest, most efficient way to succeed in today’s complex markets. Our programs are designed to accelerate and harmonize teamwork to efficiently achieve goals.</p>
						<p>Every day, HCD Learning breaks new ground for its clients in China and around the world.  With each graduate of our programs, I believe that we are unlocking new talent who are better equipped to make lasting contributions in their fields.  We delight in setting students on the pathway toward a career, helping mid-level professionals to reach their true potential, and guiding C-level executives to achieve their most ambitious business goals and discover new meaning through life-altering excursions.</p>
						<p>This is the essence of HCD Learning. </p>
						<p>Sincerely,</p>
