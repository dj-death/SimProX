If your company is exceeding the capacity utilization rate of 90% for consecutive 2 periods, the capacity will be automatically increased in the next period.

In this case, if the market requirement is higher than the established production volume, production department is able to increase the volume to reduce the loss of out-of-stocks. On the other hand, if the market requirement is less than the established production volume, production department is able to reduce the volume in order to reduce the inventories."

If you need to increase both Production Efficiency and Production Volume Flexibility, add both investments amount together and enter to Investment in Production Efficiency.

The higher Production Volume, the higher rate of Trade Expense and Wholesaler Bonus Rate will be. Your company will limit the Production Volume according to the remaining total budgets."

The Applied Technology Level for SKU in Market Profiles refers to SKU's technology level of actual market sales products.

When your cumulated production volume is very high with a certain Technology Level, the production cost will be reduced obviously by Production Efficiency. In some extreme situations, high investment in Technology Level also can lower the production costs comparing to applying lower Technology Level."

The price rank indexes of the first and second SKU are 100, the price rank index of the last SKU is 10 and the others are converted according to the proportion. That is the price rank index of SKU."
